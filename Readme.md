# Walkthrough

If you are here it is because you want to start working on AWS through
the CLI or using the python SDK.

Through the repo I will start from scratch to use the basic commands from aws
to use IAM until the last service that you need to know to win the Developer Associate exam.

I hope these documentation it as valuable for you as it is for me.

Enjoy the ride!!!
